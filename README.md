A cross-platform file preservation tool with path normalization, verification, and restoration capabilities.

## Features

- **Path Preservation**: Copy or move files with multiple path preservation styles:
  - Relative paths that maintain directory structure (`--rel`)
  - Absolute paths with drive letter preservation (`--abs`)
  - Flat structure with all files in one directory (`--flat`)
- **Verification**: File integrity verification with multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
- **Metadata**: Preserve file attributes (timestamps, permissions, etc.)
- **Manifests**: Detailed operation tracking with automatic versioning for multiple operations
- **Restoration**: Restore files to their original locations with verification
- **DazzleLink**: Optional integration with dazzlelink for enhanced metadata storage and file references
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Installation

```bash
pip install preserve
```

For full functionality on Windows, install with the Windows extras:

```bash
pip install preserve[windows]
```

For [dazzlelink](https://github.com/djdarcy/dazzlelink) integration:

```bash
pip install preserve[dazzlelink]
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Most common: Backup an entire directory with all subdirectories**

```bash
preserve COPY "C:/my-project" --recursive --rel --includeBase --dst "E:/backup"
```

**Important**: Always use `--recursive` (or `-r`) when copying directories. Without it, preserve will only look for files directly in the source directory, not in subdirectories.

**Copy specific file types from a directory tree**

```bash
preserve COPY --glob "*.docx" --srchPath "C:/documents" --recursive --dst "D:/archive"
```

**Copy files from a list (loadIncludes)**

```bash
preserve COPY --loadIncludes "files-to-copy.txt" --dst "E:/backup" --rel
```

The `files-to-copy.txt` file should contain one file path per line:
```
C:/data/report.docx
C:/projects/myapp/src/main.py
C:/photos/vacation/IMG_001.jpg
```

**Verify backup integrity**

```bash
preserve VERIFY --src "C:/my-project" --dst "E:/backup" --hash SHA256
```

**Restore files to their original locations**

```bash
# Restore latest backup
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup"

# List all available restore points
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --list

# Restore specific operation by number
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --number 2
```

### Path Preservation Options

- `--rel`: Preserve relative paths
- `--abs`: Preserve absolute paths (with drive letter as directory)
- `--flat`: Flatten directory structure (all files in destination root)
- `--includeBase`: Include base directory name in destination path

### Other Options

- `--hash`: Specify hash algorithm(s) for verification (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
- `--verify`: Verify files after operation
- `--dazzlelink`: Create dazzlelinks to original files
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without making changes
- `--overwrite`: Overwrite existing files in destination

See `preserve --help` for full documentation and examples.

## Working with Multiple Operations

Preserve automatically manages manifests when you run multiple operations to the same destination:

### Sequential Operations Example

```bash
# First operation - copies dataset A
preserve COPY "C:/data/dataset-A" -r --includeBase --rel --dst "E:/backup"
# Creates: preserve_manifest.json

# Second operation - copies dataset B
preserve COPY "C:/data/dataset-B" -r --includeBase --rel --dst "E:/backup"
# Auto-migrates first manifest to preserve_manifest_001.json
# Creates: preserve_manifest_002.json

# Third operation - copies dataset C
preserve COPY "C:/data/dataset-C" -r --includeBase --rel --dst "E:/backup"
# Creates: preserve_manifest_003.json
```

### Managing Multiple Manifests

```bash
# List all available restore points
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --list
# Output:
#   1. preserve_manifest_001.json (2025-09-18 14:30:00, 150 files)
#   2. preserve_manifest_002.json (2025-09-18 14:55:00, 75 files)
#   3. preserve_manifest_003.json (2025-09-18 15:20:00, 200 files)

# Restore specific dataset (e.g., dataset B from operation 2)
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --number 2

# Restore latest operation (dataset C)
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup"

# Restore with short option
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" -n 1  # Restores dataset A
```

### User-Friendly Manifest Naming

You can rename manifests to include descriptions:

```bash
# Rename manifests for clarity (Windows)
ren preserve_manifest_001.json preserve_manifest_001__dataset-A.json
ren preserve_manifest_002.json preserve_manifest_002__dataset-B.json

# On Linux/Mac
mv preserve_manifest_001.json preserve_manifest_001__dataset-A.json

# The descriptions appear in --list output:
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --list
#   1. preserve_manifest_001__dataset-A.json - dataset-A (2025-09-18 14:30:00, 150 files)
#   2. preserve_manifest_002__dataset-B.json - dataset-B (2025-09-18 14:55:00, 75 files)
```

### Important Notes

- **No Overwrites**: Each operation creates a new manifest, preserving all history
- **Backward Compatible**: Single operations still work exactly as before
- **Auto-Migration**: The system automatically handles the transition from single to multiple manifests
- **Independent Restoration**: Each manifest can be restored independently

## Recommended Workflow for Critical Data

For critical data, follow this secure multi-step workflow to ensure data integrity:

### Step 1: Pre-Verification (Create baseline hashes)

```bash
# Windows: Use certutil to create SHA256 hashes
cd C:\my-project
for /r %i in (*) do certutil -hashfile "%i" SHA256 >> ..\source-hashes.txt

# Linux/Mac: Use shasum or sha256sum
cd /path/to/my-project
find . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > ../source-hashes.txt
```

### Step 2: Copy with Structure Preservation

```bash
# Copy with relative paths and include base directory
preserve COPY "C:/my-project" --recursive --rel --includeBase --dst "E:/backup" --hash SHA256
```

### Step 3: Post-Copy Verification

```bash
# Verify all files match their source
preserve VERIFY --src "C:/my-project" --dst "E:/backup" --hash SHA256 --report verify-report.txt

# Check the report for any mismatches
type verify-report.txt
```

### Step 4: Test Restoration

```bash
# First, do a dry run to see what would be restored
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --dry-run

# If everything looks correct, restore to a test location
preserve RESTORE --src "E:/backup" --dst "C:/test-restore" --verify
```

### Step 5: Validate Restoration

```bash
# Compare restored files with original hashes
# Windows
cd C:\test-restore\my-project
for /r %i in (*) do certutil -hashfile "%i" SHA256 >> ..\..\restored-hashes.txt
fc ..\..\source-hashes.txt ..\..\restored-hashes.txt

# Linux/Mac
cd /path/to/test-restore/my-project
find . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > ../../restored-hashes.txt
diff ../../source-hashes.txt ../../restored-hashes.txt
```

### Step 6: Source Cleanup (Only after validation)

```bash
# Only remove originals after all verifications pass
# Keep the preserve_manifest*.json files in the backup for future restoration
```

**Important**: Never delete your source files until you've verified the backup AND successfully tested restoration.

## What's New

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes.

### Latest Release (v0.5.x)

This is a maintenance development cycle. The current goal is stabilize and fully test all major uses of preserve (COPY, MOVE, RESTORE, and VERIFY) with no missing flags / functionality before 0.6.x.

### Recent Highlights
- **Advanced Filtering**: Exclude patterns, depth control, time-based selection
- **Three-Way Verification**: Source, destination, or both forms of verifications during restore operations
- **Sequential Manifests**: Support for multiple operations to same destination
- **GitRepoKit Versioning**: Automated version management with git hooks
- **Document Tidying**: Improving versioning, README, CHANGELOG, and other docs
